# CityChronicle-Bengaluru-LandUseAnalysis
Addressed class imbalance in urbanization study of Bangalore. Applied SVM (86.5%) and Random Forest (95.4%) for change detection (2014-2020). Leveraged pixel differencing, SSIM, and MSE for accurate land cover classification.

In this project, the challenge of class imbalance is adressed while conducting a comprehensive analysis of Land Use and Land Cover Change detection in Bangalore. Focused on monitoring rapid urbanization, the study spans the years 2014, 2016, and 2020. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models such as SVM (86.5% accuracy) and Random Forest Classifier (95.4% accuracy), I successfully tracked and predicted urbanization patterns.

To ensure the precision of our findings, implemented a robust evaluation framework employing image pixel differencing, SSIM, and MSE metrics. These metrics not only provided accurate classification results but also facilitated effective detection of changes in land cover. This project contributes valuable insights into the dynamic urban landscape of Bangalore, combining sophisticated models with meticulous evaluation methods.
